# imissmylibrary

IMissMyLibrary is a website created to simulate the ambient sounds of a library. You can access it [here](https://www.imissmylibrary.com/). 
Note: This website is no longer being updated.

## how/why i made it
IMissMyLibrary was a personal learning project I took on for fun during the summer of 2021. I was entirely inspired by [IMissMyCafe](https://imissmycafe.com/), which had grown popular on social media during that time. Personally, I was (and still am) a big fan of studying and working at both caf√©s and libraries, so after realizing that there was no similar website for the latter, I decided to try making it myself.

The website is created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As a high school student, I had limited web development knowledge and was using this opportunity to practice what I already knew and, of course, to expand my knowledge. Therefore, I understand and accept that this website is poorly coded. But it works!

## usage
Simply go to [IMissMyLibrary.com](https://www.imissmylibrary.com/) to start using the website. It works best on Chrome, and on a computer/laptop. (Bad coding = not-good mobile design. Sorry). There are two main features:
1. To-Do list. Type a task into the text box on the left and hit enter to add it to the list. Click the checkmark to mark it as completed and the trash can to delete it.
2. Ambience sound. Click play on the audios you want and adjust the volume bar as you wish. You can choose to 'pause all' audios if multiple are playing and you'd like to stop all of them at once.
